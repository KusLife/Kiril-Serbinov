          <h4>HARD SKILLS:</h4>
          <p>
            I'm a self-taught JS React engineer, with couple pet-projects
            <a
              href="https://kuslife.github.io/SocialNetwork-React-Redux-BLL-DAL-API/"
              target="_blank"

            >
            and big interest in futuristic tech. <br />

            + In my pet-projects I've been using Redux in BLL creating reducers
            and React: hooks (custom as well), async await, instances in DAL to
            connect to the server. <br />
            + As well, I've tracked dev. Process by using Git/GitHub and Node
            console, so You may check all the way and technics used in my works.
            <br />
            + I have knowledge of HTML/CSS/SASS/SCSS principles with BEM and
            Prettier extension for VS-code IDEA, what allows me to create a nice
            looking UI and well readable code. <br />
            + I acquainted with Web Accessibility standards for better and
            higher ranking SEO.<br />
            + Unit testing I've done with Jest, debugging in Devtools console
            using breakpoint or set key word in code.<br />
          </p>

          <h4>SOFT SKILLS:</h4>
          <p>
            I'm in regime just cuz I like structure and order in life and things
            surrounding me, so I try to manage well my time.<br />
            Self-awareness and open-mindedness bring clarity of my work results
            or areas to improve.<br />
            I've learned English by my own (with free resources in internet) and
            am proud of it, practice & patience brought quality :)<br />

            I appreciate constructive critics and I know that growth is never
            easy, I may be wrong, but I will fix it!<br />
            Furthermore, I like challenges and solving problems, because all
            that strengthening me, critical thinking and analysis are necessary
            toolkit for adaptability in our fast pace life.

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>
            Dmitri Kuzuburden, the founder and a great lector of "IT-Incubator"
            school, gave me understanding and knowledge for begging my own path
            in to Software development. Learning new things and applying them in
            work for me like a game just for grown people. Software development
            looks like a constructor, and I'm getting happy when my code
            executes properly. I was learning all given materials by my own with
            no a mentor, looking for the solvation of any issue using: Google,
            Stack Overflow, Haber, YouTube, W3Schools, and Documentation. Now I
            have already a little community with guys like me (samurai), so we
            help each other with question about a code or associated things.

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Fifteen years ago I was interested in mobile games development, but
            then it was complicated and almost no information in internet as
            it's now, so I didn't take it seriously then. Recently, I got to a
            point in my life where I had to take a decision what I want to do
            for my future, as I'm an active person and I have many interests. I
            thought to becoming a psychologist, but after I got deeper knowing
            about this profession and compared it with my priorities, I realized
            that I wanna work with brain and logic of a computer:)
